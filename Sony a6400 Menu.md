There is so much settings it is impossible to understand them all.
Them `Menu` has 6 big chapters. They are divided into many `pages`.

## Move through the Menu

Arrows are intuitive. 
The `Central` Button is mostly for `OK`. 
The `Menu` button is mostly for `Go Back`.

## Initialize
It is possible to reset or initialize the settings when one gets lost:
Menu 5 - 7 `Setup7-7`
- `Setting Reset` has 2 options: 
	- `Camera Settings Reset` and 
	- `Initialize` 
I don't know the difference yet.

## JPG

Menu 1 - 1 `Quality/ImageSize1-1`
- `File Format` - `JPEG` 
	Some photographers like to shoot RAW because later they edit the photos on the computer. We will not do that. It takes enormous amounts of time and you go insane. RAW makes also extremely big files. We don't have enough storage for big files and no patience to wait for the transfer, saving and opening of extremely big files.
- `JPEG Quality` - `Fine`
	'Extra fine' makes very big files, I don't want that.
- `JPEG Image Size` - `L 20M` makes big files, `M 10M` makes smaller files
- `Aspect Ration` - `16:9`
	I like to watch my photos on the big TV Screen. It is 16:9.

Menu 1 - 6 `AF2`
- `AF Illuminator` - `Off`
	The red light mini flash to measure distance is annoying.

Menu 1 -13 `Focus Assist`
- `Peaking Setting` - 
	- `Peaking Display` - `On`
	- `Peaking Level` - `High`
	- `Peaking Color` - `Red`
Menu 2 - 4 `Shutter/SteadyShot`
- `Silent Shooting` - `On`

Menu 2 - 5 `Zoom`
- `Zoom Setting` - `On:ClearImage Zoom`

Menu 2 - 6 `Display/AutoReview1`
- `Grid Line` - `Rule of 3rd Grid`

Menu 5 - 1 `Setup1`
- `Volume Settings` - `1`
	I don't need a lot of sound around the camera.

Menu 5 - 5 `Setup5`
- `Format` - Erase all data from the SD Card
