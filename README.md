## Motivation

I have a new Sony A6400 photo camera.  
And now I have to learn and learn how to use it.  
There are a lot of settings, most of them are not interesting.  
The problem is to find the important one.  

## Git and GitHub

It is easy to use git and GitHub.
After initiating the repository and connecting it with the remote repository is just:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

and in the other direction

```bash
git pull
```

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
