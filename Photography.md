Technically, there is not a lot to photography.
Everything is limited and there are always compromises to be made.

- Focus - what part of the photo will be clear and without blur
- Shutter speed - makes the image brighter or dimmer. Makes fast movements blurred or clear.
- Aperture - makes the "depth of field" thicker or thinner.  Depth of field is how much of your image is in focus.
- ISO - more sensitivity comes with more noise
- Lenses - wider or narrower view angles. Better lenses have less limitations and higher prices. Best lenses are very limited, but best for a single purpose.

Then there is the artistic part:

- choice of subject
- maybe tell an interesting story
- common is boring, extraordinary is interesting
- composition
- colours
- depth of field
